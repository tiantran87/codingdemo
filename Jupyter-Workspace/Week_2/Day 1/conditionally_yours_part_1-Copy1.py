Conditionally Yours

Pseudocode:

1. Create variables for the following:

    * `original_price`
    * `current_price`
    * `increase`
    * `percent_increase`

2. Derive `increase`:
    * Increase = Current Price - Original Price
    
3. Derive `percent_increase`:
    * Percent Increase = Increase / Original x 100
    
4. Create the logic:
    * If percent_increase > 20% => Sell 
        Else HOLD
    * If percent_increase < -20% => Buy
        Else HOLD
